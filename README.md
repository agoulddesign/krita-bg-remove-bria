# krita-bg-remove-bria
A simple plugin for Krita that automatically removes the background of an image using BriaAI's API in seconds

DOWNLOAD

Setup instructions:
  1. You will need a free BriaAI account and API key. As of the writing of this document, it doesn't require a credit card and includes 1000 uses per month and very reasonable prices after that (~ $0.08 per). Go to http://www.bria.ai to sign up.

  2. Download the plugin and import in Krita through "Tools -> Scripts -> Import Python plugin from file..." (note: do not extract the files).

  3. Enable the docker window through "Settings -> Dockers -> Background Remover BriaAI".

  4. Copy your BriaAi API key from the website and paste into the API Key field.

  5. Select the layer you want to remove the background of and click Remove Background. It may take a few seconds. It will then create a new layer with an alpha channel.


Please note this plugin was created mostly with the aid of AI, and may not be optimised properly. If you have any suggestions on improving it, please let me know.

I hope you enjoy the power of automatic background removal in Krita!
